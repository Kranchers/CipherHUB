## Introduction
Welcome to my website, which showcases the projects and houses documentation for the many scripts I've worked on.
This itself is also a testament of my skill as a programmer and designer. This website serves as a more in-depth extension
of my [talent.roblox page.](https://create.roblox.com/talent/creators/20190887)

The tabs on the side are self-explanatory.
Anything in my portfolio is a showcase of my history and experience as a

I'm currently trying to get [verified](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/7997207259156-Verified-Badge-FAQ) on Roblox.
Please [follow me](https://www.roblox.com/users/20190887/profile) if you haven't already! It opens up more possibilities for me in the future.
