## Introduction
Welcome to my website, which showcases the projects and houses documentation for the many scripts I've worked on.
This itself is also a testament of my skill as a programmer and designer. This website serves as a more in-depth extension
of my [talent.roblox page.](https://create.roblox.com/talent/creators/20190887)

The tabs on the side are self-explanatory.
Anything in my portfolio is a showcase of my history and experience as a
game-developer on Roblox.
I'm currently trying to get [verified](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/7997207259156-Verified-Badge-FAQ) on Roblox.
Please [follow me](https://www.roblox.com/users/20190887/profile) if you haven't already!

## About Me
<img src="https://tr.rbxcdn.com/30DAY-AvatarHeadshot-7EE6FB472474C7A41A7FEF19417D8A94-Png/150/150/AvatarHeadshot/Png/noFilter" alt="Me"/><br>
I'm an aspiring programmer with a knack for innovation and design. Game-development is a passion to me, and I aim to do this for a living. 
Ever since I was extremely young, I've always loved playing video games. The idea of being able to immerse yourself in a brand new world always 
came off as appealing to me. My love really sparked to life when I received my first console: The Nintendo GameCube.
I experienced so many different feelings playing all of these different games. I loved every second of my experiences, and I occasionally go back to 
look at old games that brought me countless hours of joy. The idea that games can be a way to express yourself always dawned to me as the main draw
to game-development as a whole. You may notice I've taken inspiration in the projects I've worked on, like my [Untitled Platforming Game](/CipherHUB/Portfolio/Side Projects/UPG), or [Observation Room](/CipherHUB/Portfolio/Groups/Frost%20Fox%20Studio/ObservationRoom). There's a list of projects I've worked on in the portfolio section.

### Highlights
- My native language is English, but I can also speak Portuguese fluently because my family 
(on my mother's side) is entirely brazilian.
- I'm currently studying at [Full Sail University](https://www.fullsail.edu)
as a Software Engineer, and I plan to graduate with a Bachelor's Degree in October of 2025.
- My time-zone is EST. It is currently <span id="est-time"><span id="time">...</span></span> for me.

### Skills
- I'm certified in AutoCAD, Fusion360, Autodesk Inventor, and Maya.
- I can understand Spanish, and understand Chinese. I cannot speak Chinese fluently yet.
- I know the following programming languages: `C++`, `LUA`, `GML`, `PY`, `JS`, and `HTML5`.
- I have six years of experience using photoshop.
- I have four years of experience using VEGAS Pro.
- I can play both Guitar (Electric and Acoustic), and Piano.
- I'm a semi-experienced digital artist.
----
### Strengths
- I am an extremely quick learner. I'm not an expert in JS or CSS, but I figured out how to make this site in two days.
- I find helping others around me learn extremely gratifying, and I am happy to explain anything that may be
confusing to someone.
- I leave a lot of commentary on the scripts that I've created, regardless of documentation existing or not.
The less confusion the better.
- I take my career (regardless of job) very seriously and I pour as much as I can into what I do. I'm known as
a hard worker by my peers around me.
- I have very good cohesion with people on a team.
- I can retain motivation and recover from burn-out extremely fast.
----
### Weaknesses
- I have a few hobbies. (This could also be a strength in some cases.) They are just enough to be noted as an actual weakness, but they are far from obstructive.
	- I practice my Guitar every week. *(typically on Wed or Sat)*
	- I study at Full-Sail University. *(Mon-Fri)*
	- I go to the gym frequently and typically at 5PM. I'm there for 1-2 hours. *(Mon, Tue, Thur, Fri, Sat)*
- I may take a bit of time to settle into a new environment.
- Occasionally I may feel periods of lethargy. Despite that, I'm very communicative about my state mentally.

## Why this website?
I realized that the talent.roblox page doesn't do my experience justice, so I decided
to create my own webpage on github to access all of my creations. I aim to use this website
to host my portfolio and documentation for any kind of system I may (or have made) public for
people to use. I rassled this together in the span of two days, so please excuse my occasional
grammatical issues.
