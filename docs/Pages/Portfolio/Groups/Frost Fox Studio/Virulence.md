- A fully functional OTS gun system.
- A dynamic music player that updates based on what's going on.
- An inventory system that allows you to customize each division of a group.
- A deployment system that can be customized to allow specific players to spawn in some locations.
- A dynamic weather system that uses raycasts to remain accurate regardless of your location.
- A voice-line system that allows users (and NPC characters) to be more expressive.

## My contribution
I'm responsible for the majority of the programming, and all of the UI work.
All of the systems above were programmed by me.
You can see my impact in the credits of this game on the main menu.
