# Decaying Winter
A wave-based survival game that was originally designed by Archeximus and Skeletally.
No longer maintained by the two, I <i>somewhat</i> recently became a part of the team as a programmer.

Has many features that are either upcoming, or complete.<br>
Including but not limited to:

- A brand new menu.
- Calling cards.
- New difficulty options.
- New selectable perks.
- Customizable keybinds.
- A dynamic settings system.
- A complete rewrite of their game's code.
- A dynamic AI combat and pathing system.

You can look at the game [here](https://www.roblox.com/games/13438553315/Decaying-Winter).
What is seen here is the original game. Media displays the brand new content.

## My contribution
I am mostly responsible for the addition of the new content in the game, and the new UI.
You can see my impact in the credits of this game on the main menu.
