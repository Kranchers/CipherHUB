# Untitled Platforming Game
A platforming game akin to Celeste, but in a 3D environment.
I created this game in one day.

You can look at the game [here](https://www.roblox.com/games/9549672163/Observation-Room-alpha-0-1-4).

## My contribution
I've done all of the UI, programming, and map-design.
The animations were provided by [@Bravo_RBXL](https://www.roblox.com/users/415495138/profile).
