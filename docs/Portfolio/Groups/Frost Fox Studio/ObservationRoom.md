# Observation Room
An adventure/vibe game underneath Frost Fox Studio.
The main draw to this game is the large open environment. I am responsible for all of the programming and UI design.

Has many features that are either upcoming, or complete.<br>
Including but not limited to:

- A unique loading and title screen.
- A music player and visualizer. (Cave crystals pulse to the music.)
- Regional Music, Ambience, and Lighting.
- Numerous NPC vendors with their own shops and unique dialogue.
- An emote wheel.
- Animated seats players can sit on.
- A dynamic settings system.
- A flexible lighting system that utilizes [CollectionService](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/classes/CollectionService) to promote organization.
- Unique tools that add different ways to experience the game.
- Custom prompts that allow for more unique interactions without sacrificing visibility.
